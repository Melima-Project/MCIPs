Abstract
--------
Define a mechanism to Change the PPP price according to current $MUSIC price in USD


Motivation
----------
The value of $MUSIC is subject to market fluctuations. In order to provide a fair, stable and consistent revenue to musicians on the Musicoin platform, we are proposing to dynamically vary the reward to musicians from 1 PPP according to the market value of $MUSIC. For example, immediately after UBI implementation, each PPP will earn xx USD equivalent in $MUSIC, irrrespective of whether the market price of $MUSIC is 0.01 USD or 1 USD


Rationale
---------
Change the PPP price according to current $MUSIC price in USD, once it stops at a stable range of time.
