      Abstract
      ========
      Along the roadmap of $MUSIC, we are going to make $MUSIC blockchain more useful to connect real world demands. Universal Basic Income(UBI) is an idea to approach this goal by adding a reservoir to reward musicians, the same time stimulate the whole music economy. With this policy, hopefully, the whole system will attract both listeners and musicians in a drastic scale.

      Motivation
      ==========
      In design, Musicians are at the center to the success of the whole system. Without the participation of musicians, the whole system would become valueless like all other cryptocurrencies in market, given whatever money policy applied. In many cryptocurrencies realm, although miners accumulated a lot of coins, they are not going to use them with strong motivations. However, who would love to buy musicians, listeners? Maybe not. Since there are no enough musicians in the system, listeners(even music lovers) won’t see it’s valuable service to them. It becomes another chicken-egg issue, we should crack one side at least, but why not both.

      With more musicians, they can become the whole ecosystem to mine, to consume and to create more based on a deeper understanding.

      With UBI, every song is possible to be played for free to listeners, it would be possible to inflict more needs to tip, thus yield more demands for coins. In early stage, this arbitrary emission will be used to stimulate the consumption(since users doesn’t need to pay), later music listeners will be more like to tip/collect and curator their own content.

      In this way, musicians won’t need to sacrifice their income to tout listeners because there’s a basic income assured by the system, the processing will be conducted by the blockchain automatically. To music listeners, it’s just like god gift, FREE listening. They won’t hesitate to come and pick the songs they would love to have.

      However, if listeners wants more, they have to pay by themselves. Playlist is a good case to study. Since every song played is for “free” now, users don’t need to pay if they only play one song, however, if they want to organize a playlist, either for himself or for sharing, he needs have a user name to make it. For others wants to play the playlist, they need to pay to the creator of playlist to have a continuous playback one by one.


      Rationale
      =========
      The change will reduce some money supply of musicoin which helps mitigate the speed of inflation.  It will affect the consensus layer but not touching the core layer. From application layer, we have observed 1:5.5 between music playbacks and tips. It means for every music was listened, there could be 5-10 times of tips being paid from listeners. This ratio can be higher in the future as more attachment could be built between musicians and music listers.


      Specification
      =============
      Block reward will be reduced to 300/block after meeting first 1,000,000 blocks, 270 coins will go to miners, 27 will be kept as musician income via PPP(in a special wallet), and 3 will be reserved as dev fund.
